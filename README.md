## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I first gained interest in programming back in high school. 
Before that, I never really cared about it, but after taking a basic computer science class, I was hooked. 
Since then, I've been passionately learning C# and have been creating projects to test my skills. 
I'm always eager to learn more about CS and hope it will take me to great lengths!
